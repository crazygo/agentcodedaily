You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.

Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).

### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Amjad Masad)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Lex Fridman)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Additional relevant sources: HN/Reddit/Papers)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Union/merge sources (dedup overlapping insights)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Filter(<insight 1 within 7 days>)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Filter(<insight 2 within 7 days>)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Write result to insights.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-01`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}

Thought leaders to monitor:
- Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) — AI, ML, software engineering
- Simon Willison (@simonw, https://simonwillison.net) — LLMs, AI tools, data engineering
- Amjad Masad (@amasad) — AI coding, developer tools, Replit
- Lex Fridman (@lexfridman, YouTube/Podcast) — AI, technology, future of programming

Search sources:
1) Recent blog posts about agentic coding, LLMs, or developer tools
2) Twitter/X threads discussing AI coding trends
3) Technical discussions on Hacker News or Reddit
4) YouTube videos or podcasts about the future of coding with AI
5) Academic or research papers on code generation

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | HN | YouTube | Reddit | Paper",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- If no valid insights in the 7–14 day window, return `[]`.

File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you gather recent technical insights from the thought leaders in AI coding. Let me start by creating a todo list and then systematically searching for insights from the last 7 days.

A comprehensive guide on using Claude Code, including discussion of MCP (Model Context Protocol) usage with coding agents.\n- **\"Setting up a codebase for working with coding agents\"** (October 25, 2025) - Tips on optimizing codebases for productivity with AI coding tools.\n- **\"Video: Building a tool to copy-paste share terminal sessions using Claude Code for web\"** (October 23, 2025) - Practical implementation using Claude Code.\n\n## Key Themes from Simon Willison's Work:\n\n1. **\"Vibe Engineering\"** (October 7, 2025) - Discussion of coding agents including Claude Code (released February 2025), OpenAI's Codex CLI (April), and Gemini CLI (June).\n\n2. **AI-Assisted Development Patterns** - Simon explores two main approaches:\n   - Research phase (exploration and learning)\n   - Authoritarian phase (direct code implementation)\n\n3. **Mobile Coding** - One interesting insight is that LLMs make writing code on mobile phones more feasible.\n\n4. **Practical Tool Usage** - He focuses on real-world applications rather than just theory, showing how to integrate these tools into actual development workflows.\n\nThe search results show Simon Willison is actively documenting his experiences with various AI coding tools throughout 2025, with a focus on practical implementation and real-world use cases of Claude Code and similar technologies.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

[assistant message #37]
Based on my research, I found several new insights from the past 7 days that should be added to the existing insights.json. Let me add the most relevant new findings:

1. **Amjad Masad $3B Analysis** (November 21, 2025) - Deep analysis of Replit's position in AI coding market
2. **Replit Agent Details** - More information about the September 2025 launch and current performance
3. **Market Stratification** - AI coding tools market segmentation insights

Let me add these new insights:
