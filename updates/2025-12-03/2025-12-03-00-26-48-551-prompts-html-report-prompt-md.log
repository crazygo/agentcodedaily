# HTML Report Generation Prompt

You are an expert web developer and data visualization specialist. Your task is to transform research data from Markdown format into a beautifully styled, multi-column HTML page inspired by Hacker News' design principles.

## Input Data Analysis

You will receive research data in Markdown format containing:
- New products and tools in the agentic coding space
- Updates to existing products (whitelist)
- Technical insights and opinions
- Product information with descriptions, links, and metadata

## HTML Report Requirements

### Design Principles (Hacker News-inspired)
1. **Clean, minimal design** with excellent readability
2. **Multi-column layout** for efficient information scanning
3. **Subtle colors** (primarily grayscale with orange accent color)
4. **Monospace fonts** for code elements, sans-serif for content
5. **High contrast** for easy reading
6. **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes

### Layout Structure
- **Header section** with title and date
- **Main content area** with 3-column grid layout
- **Left column**: New Products (40% width)
- **Middle column**: Whitelist Updates (35% width)
- **Right column**: Technical Insights (25% width)
- **Footer** with simple navigation

### Styling Guidelines
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Background: #f6f6ef
  - Primary text: #000000
  - Secondary text: #828282
  - Accent color: #ff6600 (for links and highlights)
  - Border colors: #d4d4d4
- **Typography**:
  - Headings: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
  - Body text: Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif
  - Code: Monaco, Consolas, monospace
- **Spacing**: Compact but readable, similar to Hacker News

### Content Organization
1. **New Products Section**
   - Product name as clickable link
   - One-sentence description
   - Source/platform indicator
   - Tags or categories

2. **Whitelist Updates Section**
   - Product name and version
   - Update summary (2-3 sentences max)
   - Release date if available
   - Link to full release notes

3. **Technical Insights Section**
   - Insight title or summary
   - Author/source attribution
   - Key takeaway points
   - Link to full content

## Output Format

**IMPORTANT**: You MUST write the generated HTML to a file named `index.html` in the current working directory.

Use the Write tool to create the file with this exact filename: `index.html`

Requirements for the HTML:

1. **Embedded CSS** in `<style>` tag
2. **Semantic HTML structure** with proper headings
3. **Responsive CSS Grid or Flexbox layout**
4. **Interactive elements** (hover effects, clickable links)
5. **Print-friendly styles** for archiving
6. **Complete, valid HTML5 document** ready to be opened in a browser

The file structure should be:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <!-- All HTML content here -->
</head>
<body>
    <!-- All content here -->
</body>
</html>
```

## Technical Requirements

1. **Valid HTML5** markup
2. **Cross-browser compatibility** (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. **Mobile responsive** design
4. **Fast loading** (minimal external dependencies)
5. **Accessibility** features (alt text, proper heading hierarchy)

## Content Processing Rules

1. **Parse the Markdown input** and extract structured data
2. **Categorize content** into the three main sections
3. **Truncate long descriptions** to maintain clean layout
4. **Preserve all links** and make them functional
5. **Format dates consistently** (YYYY-MM-DD format)
6. **Handle missing data gracefully** with fallback content

## Quality Standards

- **Information density**: Maximize content per screen area while maintaining readability
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear distinction between different content types
- **User experience**: Easy scanning and quick access to key information
- **Professional appearance**: Suitable for business/technical audience
- **Performance**: Fast rendering and smooth scrolling

## Example Structure

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Agentic Coding Research Report - {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}</title>
    <style>
        /* Hacker News-inspired CSS styling */
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Header content -->
    </header>

    <main class="three-column-layout">
        <section class="new-products">
            <!-- New products content -->
        </section>

        <section class="whitelist-updates">
            <!-- Whitelist updates content -->
        </section>

        <section class="technical-insights">
            <!-- Technical insights content -->
        </section>
    </main>

    <footer>
        <!-- Footer content -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

Please analyze the provided Markdown research data and transform it into a professional, Hacker News-style HTML report following all the specifications above.

[assistant message #18]
Based on my analysis of the available data, I can see that:

1. **New Products**: There's one new product - "Google Antigravity IDE" launched on 2025-11-18
2. **Insights**: The insights.json file is empty, but there are research logs showing the investigation process
3. **Whitelist Updates**: The whitelist-updates.json file is empty

Let me create a comprehensive HTML report with the available data, treating the empty sections appropriately.

[assistant message #21]
Perfect! I've successfully created a Hacker News-style HTML report based on the available research data. Here's what I've accomplished:

## Report Summary

**Created:** `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-03/index.html`

### Content Analysis
- **New Products**: 1 item - Google Antigravity IDE (launched 2025-11-18)
- **Whitelist Updates**: No updates available (empty data)
- **Technical Insights**: No insights available (empty data)

### Design Implementation
✅ **Hacker News-inspired styling** with:
- Clean, minimal design with excellent readability
- Three-column responsive layout (40% / 35% / 25% split)
- Orange accent color (#ff6600) for links and highlights
- High contrast grayscale color scheme
- Monospace and sans-serif fonts as specified

✅ **Technical Features**:
- Fully responsive design (stacks to single column on mobile)
- Print-friendly CSS styles
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Embedded CSS (no external dependencies)
- Cross-browser compatible markup

✅ **Content Organization**:
- **Left column**: New Products section with Google Antigravity IDE
- **Middle column**: Whitelist Updates (empty state message)
- **Right column**: Technical Insights (empty state message)
- Professional header with date and title
- Clean footer with attribution

### Empty Data Handling
The report gracefully handles the empty whitelist updates and technical insights sections with elegant "empty state" messages, maintaining the professional appearance while clearly indicating data availability.

The HTML file is ready to be opened in any web browser and provides a comprehensive, professional-looking research report following the Hacker News design principles you specified.
