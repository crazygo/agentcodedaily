You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.
Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).
### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.
Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-03`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
**Date Range**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE} minus 7 days = {INSERT_START_DATE}
**IMPORTANT TIME CONSTRAINTS**:
- Only include content published/posted between {INSERT_START_DATE} and {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}
- When searching, ALWAYS use date filters: "after:{INSERT_START_DATE} before:{INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}" or equivalent date range syntax
- For Twitter/X: Use advanced search with date range filters
- For Google/Blog searches: Use "after:{INSERT_START_DATE}" or site-specific date filters
- For Hacker News/Reddit: Filter by time period (past week) or use date-based search
- For YouTube: Use upload date filter (last 7 days)
- **CRITICAL**: If a source does not have a clear publication date within the 7-day window, EXCLUDE it from results
- Verify publication dates before including in insights.json

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | YouTube | Podcast | TechMedia | HN | Reddit | Paper | Platform",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "published_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- **Date validation**: Each insight MUST include a `published_date` field, and it MUST be within the 7-day window ({INSERT_START_DATE} to {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE})
- If no valid insights in the 7-day window, return `[]`.
File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each "Record progress, rewrite todo"), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- **Before writing to insights.json**: Verify that each insight's `published_date` is within the 7-day window. Remove any insights outside this range.
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights (sorted by date, most recent first).

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you find recent AI coding thought leadership insights from the last 7 days. Let me start by setting up the todo list and checking the current state of insights.json.

[assistant message #7]
Good! The insights.json file is empty, so I'll start building it from scratch. Now I need to determine the current date and the 7-day window for searching. The current working directory shows "2025-12-03", so I'll use that as the current date.

- **Current Date**: 2025-12-03
- **Start Date**: 2025-11-26 (7 days ago)

Let me start with the first thought leader: Andrej Karpathy.

I see that the web search is not available due to rate limits. Let me try a different approach by searching for Simon Willison's blog directly since he has a well-structured website with good content filtering.

I'm encountering rate limits on both the web search and web reader tools. Let me try a different approach by using alternative search methods and available tools. Let me check if I can access some of the sources directly through other means.

[assistant message #32]
I've completed the task, but unfortunately encountered rate limits on the web search and web reader tools, which prevented me from gathering current insights from the specified sources. Here's what happened:

## Summary of Attempted Work:

**Date Range Analyzed**: 2025-11-26 to 2025-12-03 (last 7 days)

**Sources Attempted:**
- ✅ Andrej Karpathy (Twitter/X) - Rate limited
- ✅ Simon Willison (Blog/Social) - Rate limited  
- ✅ Amjad Masad (Twitter/Replit) - Rate limited
- ✅ Lex Fridman Podcast (YouTube) - Rate limited
- ✅ YouTube Channels (Two Minute Papers, Fireship, AI Explained) - Rate limited
- ✅ Podcasts (The Changelog, Software Engineering Daily, AI Podcast) - Rate limited
- ✅ Tech Media (TechCrunch, The Verge, MIT Technology Review) - Rate limited
- ✅ Technical Platforms (ArXiv, Papers with Code, Towards Data Science) - Rate limited
- ✅ Community (Hacker News, Reddit) - Rate limited

## Result:
`insights.json` has been updated with an empty array `[]` since I was unable to access any current content due to the rate limiting issues with both the web search and web reader tools.

## Recommendations:
1. **Try again later** - The rate limits should reset
2. **Direct API access** - Consider using direct RSS feeds or APIs for the blogs/podcasts
3. **Alternative search methods** - Use other search engines or directly visit the source websites

The todo list has been properly maintained and all steps have been attempted and documented.
