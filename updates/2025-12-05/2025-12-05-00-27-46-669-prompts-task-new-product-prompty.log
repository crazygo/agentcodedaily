[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-05`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you research newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days. Let me start by creating a structured TODO list to organize this research systematically.

        "text": "This session is being continued from a previous conversation that ran out of context. The conversation is summarized below:\nAnalysis:\nLet me chronologically analyze the conversation to understand the user's requests and my actions:\n\n1. **Initial Request**: The user provided a working directory context and a detailed research task with 7 specific questions about newly launched AI coding products from the last 14 days (December 2024). The questions covered different categories of AI coding tools.\n\n2. **My Approach**: I created a structured TODO list to organize the research systematically, breaking down each question into research, progress recording, and result aggregation tasks.\n\n3. **Technical Implementation**: I attempted to start research for QUESTION 1 (full AI IDEs) but encountered web search and web reader tool usage limits, which prevented me from accessing external sources.\n\n4. **File Operations**: I successfully created an empty `new-product.json` file to store results but couldn't populate it due to the web access limitations.\n\n5. **Current State**: I'm stuck at the research phase due to tool limitations, with the TODO list showing QUESTION 1 as \"in_progress\" and all subsequent tasks as \"pending\".\n\nKey technical details:\n- Working directory: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-05`\n- Output file: `new-product.json` (created but empty)\n- 7 research questions covering different AI coding tool categories\n- Systematic TODO list with 21 tasks\n- Web tool usage limits reached for both search and reading functions\n\nSummary:\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user requested a comprehensive research task to identify newly launched AI coding products from the last 14 days (December 2024). The research should be organized around 7 specific questions:\n   - QUESTION 1: Full AI IDEs (similar to Windsurf/Cursor)\n   - QUESTION 2: AI coding CLIs/terminal agents (like Gemini/Codex CLI)\n   - QUESTION 5: Specialized workflow tools (debugging, refactoring, etc.)\n   - QUESTION 7: AI agents with project memory/workspace memory\n   - QUESTION 11: Open-source AI coding agents for self-hosting\n   - QUESTION 14: AI tools that integrate into existing IDEs\n   - QUESTION 16: AI agents for workflow orchestration (CI/CD, deployment, etc.)\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - AI IDEs and coding assistants\n   - Terminal-based AI agents\n   - Project memory and workspace persistence\n   - Open-source AI coding tools\n   - IDE integrations and plugins\n   - Workflow orchestration agents\n   - Product research methodology with 14-day launch window\n   - TODO list management and progress tracking\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n   - `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-05/new-product.json`\n     - Created as empty array `[]`\n     - Intended to store research results for newly launched AI coding products\n     - Currently empty due to research limitations\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Web Search Limit Error**: WebSearch tool returned monthly usage limit error: \"I'm unable to perform the web search at this time. The search tool has reached its monthly usage limit and won't reset until January 1, 2026.\"\n   - **Web Reader Limit Error**: Multiple webReader tool calls returned error: \"MCP error -429: {\\\"error\\\":{\\\"code\\\":\\\"1308\\\",\\\"message\\\":\\\"已达到 1 月的使用上限。您的限额将在 2026-01-01 00:00:00 重置。\\\"}}\"\n   - **No Fixes Applied**: The usage limits could not be bypassed, leaving the research task incomplete.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   Successfully created a structured TODO list to systematically approach the research task across 7 questions. However, encountered fundamental limitation with web access tools that prevented gathering the required data. The systematic approach included:\n   - Individual research for each question\n   - Progress recording after each research phase\n   - Union of all results\n   - Filtering by launch date and relevance\n   - Sorting and final output generation\n\n6. All user messages:\n   - Initial comprehensive research request with 7 specific questions about newly launched AI coding products from the last 14 days, including working directory context and detailed question specifications.\n   - Request for conversation summary (current message).\n\n7. Pending Tasks:\n   - Research for all 7 questions (QUESTIONS 1, 2, 5, 7, 11, 14, 16)\n   - Progress recording after each research phase\n   - Union of all source results\n   - Filter results by launch date (≤ 14 days) and AI coding relevance\n   - Sort filtered results\n   - Write final results to new-product.json\n\n8. Current Work:\n   I was attempting to research QUESTION 1 (full AI IDEs launched in last 14 days) when the web search and web reader tools reached their usage limits. The TODO list shows \"Sources(QUESTION 1): Research full AI IDEs launched in last 14 days\" as \"in_progress\". I had successfully created the new-product.json file but couldn't populate it with research data due to the web access limitations.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   The next step would be to find alternative methods for gathering information about newly launched AI coding tools, potentially by:\n   - Using specific direct URLs for known AI coding tool launch platforms\n   - Accessing RSS feeds or API endpoints if available\n   - Requesting the user to provide specific URLs or information sources\n   However, this would require confirming with the user first since the current web access limitations prevent completing the original research task as specified..\nPlease continue the conversation from where we left it off without asking the user any further questions. Continue with the last task that you were asked to work on."

I'll continue with the research task despite the web tool limitations. Let me try a different approach to gather information about newly launched AI coding products by using targeted searches and direct URL access.
