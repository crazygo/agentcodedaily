    "description": "Simon Willison highlighted Atharva Raykar's analysis of AI-assisted development, emphasizing that AI is a multiplier - the more software engineering expertise you have, the better results you can get from LLMs. Key insights include the importance of good test coverage, linting, CI/CD, and clear documentation for effective AI collaboration. Also noted changes in development practices: less emphasis on premature abstraction since LLMs make repetition palatable, and the critical importance of testing since AI can generate tests rapidly.",

    "description": "Willison shared Armin Ronacher's actionable advice for using Claude Code effectively, highlighting excellent results from Go development. Key tip: making tools (linters, tests, logs, dev servers) accessible through documented Makefiles. Critical insight about logging: in debug mode, emails are logged to stdout, allowing agents to complete full sign-in flows with remote browsers by consulting logs for necessary links.",
