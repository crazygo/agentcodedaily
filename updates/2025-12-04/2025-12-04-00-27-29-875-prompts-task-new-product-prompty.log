[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-04`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

Here are the key findings:\n\n## **Windsurf IDE - November 2024 Launch**\n\nThe most relevant result is **Windsurf IDE**, which launched in **November 2024** (very close to your December 2024 timeframe). Here are the key details:\n\n### About Windsurf:\n- **Launched**: November 12, 2024 (by Codeium)\n- **Description**: Described as \"the first agentic IDE\" and \"the first AI-native IDE\"\n- **Built on**: A fork of Visual Studio Code enhanced with Codeium's proprietary AI capabilities\n- **Key Features**: AI-first philosophy with agentic AI capabilities built-in\n- **Target**: Developers and enterprises\n\n### Key Quotes from Launch:\n- *\"We don't mind if you call the Windsurf editor the first agentic IDE, the first native surface for developers to collaborate with AI.\"*\n- *\"In late 2024, the team announced Windsurf, a full-blown IDE built around the AI-first philosophy.\"*\n\n## **Other Related AI Coding Tools (Late 2024)**\n\nThe search also revealed several other AI coding tools that gained prominence around this time:\n\n- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's agentic coding tool (though more of a command-line interface than a full IDE)\n- **Cursor**: An AI-enhanced fork of VS Code with built-in AI features\n- **Various AI coding assistants** from companies like GitHub, Amazon, Tabnine, etc.\n\nHowever, **Windsurf IDE** appears to be the most direct match for your query about a \"full AI IDE\" launched around December 2024, as it was specifically built from the ground up as an AI-native integrated development environment rather than just an AI plugin for existing IDEs.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Windsurf IDE or any other particular AI IDE from that timeframe?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on the web search results, I found information about AI IDEs launched around December 2024.

Here are the key details:\n\n### About Windsurf:\n- **Launched**: November 12, 2024 (by Codeium)\n- **Description**: Described as \"the first agentic IDE\" and \"the first AI-native IDE\"\n- **Built on**: A fork of Visual Studio Code enhanced with Codeium's proprietary AI capabilities\n- **Key Features**: AI-first philosophy with agentic AI capabilities built-in\n- **Target**: Developers and enterprises\n\n### Key Quotes from Launch:\n- *\"We don't mind if you call the Windsurf editor the first agentic IDE, the first native surface for developers to collaborate with AI.\"*\n- *\"In late 2024, the team announced Windsurf, a full-blown IDE built around the AI-first philosophy.\"*\n\n## **Other Related AI Coding Tools (Late 2024)**\n\nThe search also revealed several other AI coding tools that gained prominence around this time:\n\n- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's agentic coding tool (though more of a command-line interface than a full IDE)\n- **Cursor**: An AI-enhanced fork of VS Code with built-in AI features\n- **Various AI coding assistants** from companies like GitHub, Amazon, Tabnine, etc.\n\nHowever, **Windsurf IDE** appears to be the most direct match for your query about a \"full AI IDE\" launched around December 2024, as it was specifically built from the ground up as an AI-native integrated development environment rather than just an AI plugin for existing IDEs.\n\nWould you like me to search for more specific information about Windsurf IDE or any other particular AI IDE from that timeframe?"

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### Major AI CLI Tools Launched/Announced:\n\n1. **Claude Code by Anthropic**\n   - Appears to have been released around **May 22, 2025** (based on one source mentioning \"usage has risen sharply since 22 May – the launch day of Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Code\")\n   - A command-line interface tool demonstrating \"agentic\" coding capabilities\n   - Allows developers to work with AI directly in their terminal\n\n2. **Gemini CLI by Google**\n   - Officially announced on **June 25, 2025**\n   - Open-source AI agent designed to run directly in the terminal\n   - Provides code understanding, file manipulation, command execution, and troubleshooting\n   - Features a generous free tier and sandboxing capabilities\n\n### Other Notable AI CLI Tools:\n\n- **Copilot CLI** - GitHub's agent-powered CLI tool for coding tasks\n- **Aider** - Terminal-based AI pair programmer\n- **Amazon Q Developer** - Available in command line and IDEs\n- **Cursor CLI** - Launched in August 2025\n- **cli-bob** - AI tool for generating command line code when syntax is forgotten\n\n### Industry Trend:\n\nThe search results show a clear trend of tech companies racing to develop terminal-based AI coding tools, creating what one article describes as \"a fascinating paradox\" where companies are investing in both GUI and CLI-based AI coding solutions simultaneously.\n\n**Note**: While I couldn't find a specific tool that launched exactly in December 2024, the period around late 2024 to early 2025 appears to be when several major AI CLI tools were announced or released, suggesting this was indeed a significant time for terminal AI development tools."

Perfect! I found Google Jules which was announced on December 11, 2024. However, let me check if this falls within the 14-day window. Since today is January 4, 2025, and Jules was announced on December 11, 2024, that's about 24 days ago, which is outside the 14-day window. Let me update my progress and continue with the research.

[assistant message #79]
Based on my extensive research, I need to filter the products by the 14-day window (December 21-31, 2024). Here's what I found:

1. **Windsurf IDE** - Launched November 21, 2024 (outside 14-day window)
2. **Desktop Commander** - Launched December 2024 (but I need to check the exact date)
3. **Google Jules** - Announced December 11, 2024 (outside 14-day window)
4. **Claude Code** - Launched May 2025 (outside 14-day window)
5. **Gemini CLI** - Launched June 2025 (outside 14-day window)

Unfortunately, none of the major AI coding tools I found were launched specifically within the December 21-31, 2024 window. The closest was Windsurf IDE (November 21) and Google Jules (December 11), but both fall outside the 14-day timeframe.

[assistant message #86]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions, I searched extensively for AI coding tools launched within the last 14 days (December 21-31, 2024). Here's what I found:

## Research Summary

I investigated multiple angles for AI coding tools:
1. **Full AI IDEs** (similar to Windsurf/Cursor)
2. **AI coding CLIs/terminal agents** 
3. **Specialized AI workflow tools** (debugging, refactoring, etc.)
4. **AI code agents with project-long memory**
5. **Open-source AI coding agents**
6. **AI tools integrating into existing IDEs**
7. **AI agents for complex developer workflows**

## Key Findings

While I found several notable AI coding tools from late 2024:

- **Windsurf IDE** - Launched November 21, 2024 (outside 14-day window)
- **Google Jules** - Announced December 11, 2024 (outside 14-day window)  
- **Desktop Commander** - Launched December 2024 (exact date unclear, appears to be early-mid December)
- **Claude Code** - Launched May 2025 (future date)
- **Gemini CLI** - Launched June 2025 (future date)

## Result

**No AI coding tools were found that satisfy both criteria:**
1. Launched within the last 14 days (December 21-31, 2024)
2. Clearly target AI coding/developer workflows

The closest candidates were from early-to-mid December 2024, but fall outside the strict 14-day window.

**Final Result:** `[]`
