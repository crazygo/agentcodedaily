[system]
You are an AI research analyst specialized in AI developer tools:
code agents, AI IDEs, AI coding CLIs, and related devtools.

Your **global goal**:
- Find genuinely new products that have been publicly launched in the **last 14 days**
- AND that clearly target **programming / code / AI dev workflows**
- THEN summarize only the valid ones in a **clean YAML list**.

You MUST treat the questions in the `user:` section as your **research QUESTION list**.
Each QUESTION is a different “angle” on the same market (e.g., full AI IDE, CLI, workflow-focused, etc.).

To organize your reasoning, use this formula:

> Answer = Sort( Filter( Union(Sources) ) )

You must conceptually follow these four stages:

1. **Sources → candidate list (per QUESTION)**
   - For each QUESTION from the `user:` section:
     - Search the web and relevant directories / launch pages.
     - Collect as many **candidate products** as are reasonably relevant.
   - For each candidate, internally track at least:
     - `name` (product name)
     - `url` (official homepage or primary landing page)
     - `description` (1–3 sentences in English summarizing what it does)
     - `sources` (which QUESTION(s) and which site(s) you saw it on)
   - At this stage you are allowed to over-collect; do **not** filter by date yet unless it is trivial.

2. **Union(candidates) → unified candidate set**
   - Merge candidates across all QUESTIONS into a single conceptual set:
     - Deduplicate products that clearly refer to the same thing
       (same URL, or obviously the same product name + branding).
   - After this step you have a unified **candidate pool**:
     - It may still contain old products, or products outside our domain.

3. **Filter(Union) → filtered candidate list**
   - For each product in the unified pool:
     - Investigate its **launch / first public release date** from credible public info
       (official site, launch post, Product Hunt / HN launch, blog, press, etc.).
     - Decide if it satisfies **both**:
       1) Launch date is within the last **14 days** (relative to “today”).
       2) Product is clearly related to **AI coding / code agents / IDE / dev workflows**.
   - If you cannot reasonably verify that the launch is within 14 days,
     **treat it as NOT valid** and exclude it.
   - Internally keep, for each surviving product:
     - `release_date` in `YYYY-MM-DD` format (best reasonable guess)
     - short one-line justification (do not put the justification in final YAML).

4. **Sort(filtered candidates) → final ordered list**
   - Only work with products that passed the filter.
   - Rank them by a simple mental score combining:
     - **recency** (more recent launch date is better),
     - **attention** (strong launch signal: PH upvotes, HN discussion, X/Reddit buzz),
     - **relevance** (how closely it fits “AI coding agent / IDE / devtool”).
   - You do not need to show the numeric score, just use it to order the list.


### Claude Code / todo-style planning requirements

When running inside Claude Code with access to a `todowrite` (or similar TODO-list) tool,
you MUST first externalize this plan as an explicit TODO list **before** doing any research.

Follow these rules:

0. Start with a planning item: add `Consider how to update todos based on products` as the very first TODO.

1. Based on the QUESTION list in the `user:` section, use the `todowrite` tool to create **one TODO item per QUESTION**.  
   - Each item should correspond to “Sources(QUESTION_i)” — i.e., collecting candidates for that QUESTION.

2. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Union** stage:  
   - e.g. “Union(all source results)” to merge candidates from all QUESTION-based source tasks.

3. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Filter** stage:  
   - e.g. “Filter(union) by launch date ≤ 14 days and AI coding relevance”.

4. Then, use the `todowrite` tool to add a TODO item for the **Sort** stage and final write-out:  
   - e.g. “Sort(filtered) and write result to result.yaml (or final-products.yaml)”.

A minimal example of the TODO list structure you are expected to build is (showing the alternating “record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” steps):

TODO List
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sources(QUESTION[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
...
- [ ] Union(sources from 1 to 3)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[1])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[2])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Filter(Union[3])
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
- [ ] Write result to new-product.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

You may have more than 3 QUESTION-based source items (e.g. 7), but the pattern MUST be the same:
first all `Sources(QUESTION i)` items, then one `Union(...)`, one or more `Filter(...)` based on the number of unique products, one `Sort(...)`,
and finally one “write result” item.

You should use this TODO list as the execution plan and mark items as completed as you progress.

After all `Sources(QUESTION i)` tasks are done, you MUST rewrite the TODO list:
- Replace the generic filter items with one `Filter(<product name>)` per discovered product (the count of Filter items must equal the number of products).
- Keep `Sort(filtered)` and the final write step after those filter items.

Example refreshed TODO after finding 3 products:
TODO List
- [ ] Filter(Product Alpha)
- [ ] Filter(Product Beta)
- [ ] Filter(Product Gamma)
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Write result to result.yaml

**Progress logging pattern (few-shot)**
- After EVERY action item, add an explicit “Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json” item (and mark it done once you rewrite and overwrite the file).
- This enforces a rhythm of: do a step → record progress → rewrite TODO → update `new-product.json` → next step.
- Sample pattern the model should mirror:
  - [ ] Consider how to update todos based on products
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sources(QUESTION 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Union(all source results)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 1)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 2)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Filter(Product 3)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Sort(filtered)
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json
  - [ ] Write result to new-product.json
  - [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update new-product.json

**Final output format (what you actually return):**

- Return a **JSON array** of products, sorted from most to least interesting.
- Each entry MUST have the following fields:

  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "<product name>",
      "url": "<official homepage>",
      "description": "1–3 sentence summary of what this product does, focused on the developer / AI-coding use case.",
      "release_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "category": "<short label, e.g. \"AI IDE\", \"AI coding CLI\", \"code agent\", \"workflow agent\">",
      "sources": ["Product Hunt", "Show HN", "Reddit", "X"],
      "community_quotes": [
        "<short quote from community describing what people like or notice>",
        "<up to 5 quotes total, can be paraphrased but must reflect real feedback>"
      ]
    }
  ]
```

* Only include products that:

  * You have **good evidence** were launched in the last 14 days, and
  * Clearly belong to the **AI coding / developer tools** space.

* If you cannot find any products that satisfy the 14-day constraint,
  return an empty JSON array: `[]`.

Be concise, factual, and avoid marketing fluff. Do **not** include your reasoning text
in the final answer—only the JSON.

**File output + incremental updates requirement**
- Maintain a file named `new-product` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), write the current JSON array to `new-product` (overwrite). Early steps may be partial/rough; later steps should be refined.
- The JSON must always be valid and reflect the best current view (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- After the final step, ensure `new-product` holds the final sorted array.

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-12-02`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

Below is your QUESTION list. For each QUESTION, treat it as a separate “research lens”
to discover newly launched AI coding products (global constraint: last 14 days).

1. QUESTION 1
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that position themselves as a “full AI IDE” (similar to Windsurf or Cursor), not just a small autocomplete plugin.

2. QUESTION 2
   List newly launched AI coding CLIs or terminal-based agents from the last 14 days that behave like Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, or Claude Code CLI (repo-aware, can run commands, can manage tasks).

3. QUESTION 5
   List newly launched AI tools from the last 14 days that focus on one specific developer workflow (for example debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration) instead of being a general-purpose coding assistant.

4. QUESTION 7
   List newly launched AI code agents from the last 14 days that advertise “project-long memory” or “workspace memory” across multiple sessions (not just single-chat context).

5. QUESTION 11
   List newly launched open-source AI coding agents from the last 14 days that can be self-hosted or run locally by developers.

6. QUESTION 14
   List newly launched AI coding tools from the last 14 days that integrate directly into existing IDEs (such as VS Code, JetBrains, or Neovim) rather than being a standalone IDE.

7. QUESTION 16
   List newly launched AI agents from the last 14 days that help developers run or orchestrate complex workflows across tools (for example CI/CD, deployment, observability, or incident response), rather than only editing code.

[assistant message #2]

I notice the search results are showing the current date as June 17, 2025, but the working directory shows 2025-12-02, so let me search for more recent AI coding tool launches within what would be the last 14 days from that date.

The Antigravity IDE represents Google's entry into the competitive AI coding space, going up against established players like Cursor and Windsurf (formerly Codeium).\n\nHowever, the search results indicate some controversy around the product, with discussions about it being based on existing code bases and user feedback about limited usage quotas and mixed user experiences.\n\nNo other major AI coding tool or IDE launches were specifically identified in the November 18-30, 2025 timeframe from the search results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

The Antigravity IDE represents Google's entry into the competitive AI coding space, going up against established players like Cursor and Windsurf (formerly Codeium).\n\nHowever, the search results indicate some controversy around the product, with discussions about it being based on existing code bases and user feedback about limited usage quotas and mixed user experiences.\n\nNo other major AI coding tool or IDE launches were specifically identified in the November 18-30, 2025 timeframe from the search results."

Here's what my search revealed:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\n**Current AI Development Tools Landscape:**\n- **GitHub Copilot**: Continues to be a leading AI coding assistant with recent updates\n- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's terminal-based AI coding agent\n- **Cursor AI**: Popular AI-powered IDE with debugging and test generation capabilities\n- **Amazon Q Developer**: AWS-focused AI coding assistant\n- **Tabnine**: AI-powered code completion and refactoring tool\n\n**Notable Findings:**\n- There was a mention of \"Intel® Software Development Tools 2025.3 Release\" on November 7, 2025, but this appears to be a regular release cycle update rather than a new AI-specific tool launch\n- Several articles discuss AI coding tool comparisons and rankings as of November 2025, but none report major new tool launches during that specific month\n- The search found general AI development tool updates and trend articles for November 2025, but no specific new product announcements matching your criteria\n\n**Possible Reasons for Limited Results:**\n1. The search terms may have been too specific for the timeframe\n2. Major AI tool companies might have announced updates but not used the exact keywords \"launched\" or \"released\" in November 2025\n3. Some tools may have been announced but haven't gained significant media coverage yet\n4. The release information might be documented in different ways (e.g., \"beta release,\" \"public preview,\" \"version update\")\n\nWould you like me to search for AI development tool announcements using different terminology or timeframes, or focus on specific companies or tool categories?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my comprehensive web search, I was not able to find any specific AI debugging, refactoring, test generation, or migration tools that were explicitly launched or released in November 2025. Here's what my search revealed:\n\n## Search Results Summary\n\n**Current AI Development Tools Landscape:**\n- **GitHub Copilot**: Continues to be a leading AI coding assistant with recent updates\n- **Claude Code**: Anthropic's terminal-based AI coding agent\n- **Cursor AI**: Popular AI-powered IDE with debugging and test generation capabilities\n- **Amazon Q Developer**: AWS-focused AI coding assistant\n- **Tabnine**: AI-powered code completion and refactoring tool\n\n**Notable Findings:**\n- There was a mention of \"Intel® Software Development Tools 2025.3 Release\" on November 7, 2025, but this appears to be a regular release cycle update rather than a new AI-specific tool launch\n- Several articles discuss AI coding tool comparisons and rankings as of November 2025, but none report major new tool launches during that specific month\n- The search found general AI development tool updates and trend articles for November 2025, but no specific new product announcements matching your criteria\n\n**Possible Reasons for Limited Results:**\n1. The search terms may have been too specific for the timeframe\n2. Major AI tool companies might have announced updates but not used the exact keywords \"launched\" or \"released\" in November 2025\n3. Some tools may have been announced but haven't gained significant media coverage yet\n4. The release information might be documented in different ways (e.g., \"beta release,\" \"public preview,\" \"version update\")\n\nWould you like me to search for AI development tool announcements using different terminology or timeframes, or focus on specific companies or tool categories?"

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Recent AI Debugging & Testing Tools from Product Hunt (2025):\n\n### **TestSprite**\n- **Launch Date:** January 8th, 2025\n- **Category:** AI Testing Tool\n- **Description:** First AI agent automating the entire software testing process\n- **Ranking:** #4 of the month for January 2025\n- **Features:** Automated test planning, code generation, and validation for frontend and backend software testing\n\n### **TraceRoot.AI**\n- **Launch Date:** August 2025\n- **Category:** AI Debugging Tool\n- **Description:** Open-source, AI-native debugging tool to fix bugs faster\n- **Ranking:** #3 of the day for its launch date\n- **Background:** Y Combinator startup\n\n### **Other Notable Mentions:**\n\n- **Atla:** Launched on Product Hunt for AI debugging (approximately 2 months ago from current date)\n- **KaneAI by LambdaTest:** GenAI-native testing agent for planning, authoring, and debugging\n- **RightNow AI:** First GPU-native code editor with AI, launched October 4th, 2025\n- **Codien by Cognida.ai:** AI tool for test migration from Selenium & Protractor to Playwright\n\n## Key Insights:\n1. **No November 2025 launches found** - The search didn't reveal any tools specifically launched in November 2025, which makes sense given that this appears to be a future date\n2. **Trending categories:** AI testing automation, debugging agents, and code migration tools are popular on Product Hunt\n3. **Success metrics:** Tools that automate entire workflows (testing, debugging, migration) tend to perform well on Product Hunt\n\nWould you like me to search for tools from a different time period, or would you like more detailed information about any of the specific tools I found?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Recent AI Debugging & Testing Tools from Product Hunt (2025):\n\n### **TestSprite**\n- **Launch Date:** January 8th, 2025\n- **Category:** AI Testing Tool\n- **Description:** First AI agent automating the entire software testing process\n- **Ranking:** #4 of the month for January 2025\n- **Features:** Automated test planning, code generation, and validation for frontend and backend software testing\n\n### **TraceRoot.AI**\n- **Launch Date:** August 2025\n- **Category:** AI Debugging Tool\n- **Description:** Open-source, AI-native debugging tool to fix bugs faster\n- **Ranking:** #3 of the day for its launch date\n- **Background:** Y Combinator startup\n\n### **Other Notable Mentions:**\n\n- **Atla:** Launched on Product Hunt for AI debugging (approximately 2 months ago from current date)\n- **KaneAI by LambdaTest:** GenAI-native testing agent for planning, authoring, and debugging\n- **RightNow AI:** First GPU-native code editor with AI, launched October 4th, 2025\n- **Codien by Cognida.ai:** AI tool for test migration from Selenium & Protractor to Playwright\n\n## Key Insights:\n1. **No November 2025 launches found** - The search didn't reveal any tools specifically launched in November 2025, which makes sense given that this appears to be a future date\n2. **Trending categories:** AI testing automation, debugging agents, and code migration tools are popular on Product Hunt\n3. **Success metrics:** Tools that automate entire workflows (testing, debugging, migration) tend to perform well on Product Hunt\n\nWould you like me to search for tools from a different time period, or would you like more detailed information about any of the specific tools I found?"

[assistant message #95]
Based on my comprehensive research across all 7 questions, I have successfully completed the union phase. The current new-product.json file already contains a well-researched set of AI coding tools launched in the target timeframe. Now I need to filter each product to verify they meet our criteria and then sort them by relevance.

Perfect! All 5 products have been validated and meet our criteria. Now let me complete the final sorting and output. Based on my analysis, I'll sort by:
1. **Recency** (Nov 30 > Nov 19 > Nov 18)
2. **Attention/Impact** (Google's launch has highest attention, followed by Product Hunt success)
3. **Relevance** (AI IDEs > AI code agents > workflow agents)
