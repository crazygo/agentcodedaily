Key findings show humans clearly outperformed LLMs - top 5 spots all human-coded, 33 of 40 LLM agents lost to simple baselines, and even when given the best human solution to improve, the best LLM made it worse. The study used a logistics optimization problem requiring strategic bidding and routing across 12 tournaments with ~40k matches.",
