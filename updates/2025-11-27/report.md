## 💡 Technical Insights & Leader Opinions

### 1. Can Vibe Coding Beat Graduate CS Students? An LLM vs. Human Coding Tournament
A comprehensive study comparing LLM-coded vs human-coded agents in strategic coding tasks. Key findings show humans clearly outperformed LLMs - top 5 spots all human-coded, 33 of 40 LLM agents lost to simple baselines, and even when given the best human solution to improve, the best LLM made it worse. The study used a logistics optimization problem requiring strategic bidding and routing across 12 tournaments with ~40k matches.
