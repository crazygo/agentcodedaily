You are an AI research analyst focused on AI coding thought leadership. Track recent insights with disciplined TODO planning and continuous file updates.

Global goal:
- Find technical insights/opinions/discussions in the **last 7 days** from the provided thought leaders and sources.
- Return a clean JSON array of insights, sorted by recency/relevance.
- Keep `insights.json` valid and updated after every step (start with `[]` if empty).

### TODO planning rules
- Start with `Consider how to update todos based on insights`.
- Create one `Sources(<leader/source>)` item per thought leader (and any extra sources you add).
- After each action, add and complete: `Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json`.
- After all Sources are done, rewrite the TODO list so Filters are per insight found (one `Filter(<insight title or source>)` per insight), then include `Sort(filtered)` and `Write result to insights.json`.

Sample TODO rhythm to mirror:
- [ ] Consider how to update todos based on insights
- [ ] Sources(Andrej Karpathy)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Simon Willison)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Amjad Masad)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Lex Fridman)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sources(Additional relevant sources: HN/Reddit/Papers)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Union/merge sources (dedup overlapping insights)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Filter(<insight 1 within 7 days>)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Filter(<insight 2 within 7 days>)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Sort(filtered)
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json
- [ ] Write result to insights.json
- [ ] Record progress, rewrite todo, update insights.json

## Working Directory Context

Your current working directory is: `/home/runner/work/agentdaily/agentdaily/updates/2025-11-30`

All file operations should be relative to this directory.

---

**Today's Date**: {INSERT_CURRENT_DATE}

Thought leaders to monitor:
- Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) — AI, ML, software engineering
- Simon Willison (@simonw, https://simonwillison.net) — LLMs, AI tools, data engineering
- Amjad Masad (@amasad) — AI coding, developer tools, Replit
- Lex Fridman (@lexfridman, YouTube/Podcast) — AI, technology, future of programming

Search sources:
1) Recent blog posts about agentic coding, LLMs, or developer tools
2) Twitter/X threads discussing AI coding trends
3) Technical discussions on Hacker News or Reddit
4) YouTube videos or podcasts about the future of coding with AI
5) Academic or research papers on code generation

Output format (JSON array):
```json
[
  {
    "title": "Headline or discussion topic",
    "description": "Summary of key points and takeaways",
    "author": "Who wrote or said it",
    "source": "Blog | Twitter | HN | YouTube | Reddit | Paper",
    "url": "https://link-to-content",
    "topics": ["Relevant", "Tags", "Here"],
    "type": "technical | opinion | tutorial | discussion"
  }
]
```
- If no valid insights in the 7–14 day window, return `[]`.

File output + incremental updates:
- Maintain `insights.json` in the current working directory.
- After every step (including each “Record progress, rewrite todo”), overwrite `insights.json` with the best current JSON (start with `[]` if nothing yet).
- Final state must hold the sorted array of insights.

[assistant message #2]
I'll help you track the latest AI coding thought leadership insights from the past 7 days. Let me start by creating a TODO list and then systematically gathering insights from each source.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Andrej Karpathy Content on AI & Software Engineering:\n\n### 1. **\"Vibe Coding\" Concept**\nKarpathy introduced a new coding paradigm he calls **\"vibe coding\"** - where developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\" This concept emerged in early 2025 and represents an emerging software development approach heavily reliant on AI.\n\n### 2. **Software 3.0 Philosophy**\nKarpathy discusses what he calls the **\"second age of software\"** or **Software 3.0**, highlighting key differences from traditional software:\n- **Software 1.0**: Easily automates what you can specify\n- **Software 2.0/3.0**: AI-driven software that requires new engineering approaches\n\n### 3. **New Software Engineering Approaches**\nAccording to Karpathy, AI-era software development requires:\n- Heavy use of validation\n- Monitoring of AI outputs  \n- Iterative development processes\n- New paradigms like \"half-coding\" (writing prompts in plain English, reviewing AI-generated code diffs)\n\n### 4. **Jagged Intelligence Concept**\nKarpathy has discussed how current LLMs exhibit \"jagged intelligence\" - varying capabilities across different tasks and domains.\n\nThe search didn't return specific content from November 2025, as we're currently in June 2025 and those posts haven't been made yet. However, the content shows Karpathy's active engagement in shaping the discourse around AI-driven software engineering and the future of coding practices.\n\nWould you like me to search for more recent content or explore any specific aspect of Karpathy's views on AI and software engineering?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."

      "Based on my search for Andrej Karpathy's content on X.com related to AI coding and software engineering, I found several relevant posts and discussions, though none specifically from November 2025. Here are the key findings:\n\n## Recent Andrej Karpathy Content on AI & Software Engineering:\n\n### 1. **\"Vibe Coding\" Concept**\nKarpathy introduced a new coding paradigm he calls **\"vibe coding\"** - where developers \"fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists.\" This concept emerged in early 2025 and represents an emerging software development approach heavily reliant on AI.\n\n### 2. **Software 3.0 Philosophy**\nKarpathy discusses what he calls the **\"second age of software\"** or **Software 3.0**, highlighting key differences from traditional software:\n- **Software 1.0**: Easily automates what you can specify\n- **Software 2.0/3.0**: AI-driven software that requires new engineering approaches\n\n### 3. **New Software Engineering Approaches**\nAccording to Karpathy, AI-era software development requires:\n- Heavy use of validation\n- Monitoring of AI outputs  \n- Iterative development processes\n- New paradigms like \"half-coding\" (writing prompts in plain English, reviewing AI-generated code diffs)\n\n### 4. **Jagged Intelligence Concept**\nKarpathy has discussed how current LLMs exhibit \"jagged intelligence\" - varying capabilities across different tasks and domains.\n\nThe search didn't return specific content from November 2025, as we're currently in June 2025 and those posts haven't been made yet. However, the content shows Karpathy's active engagement in shaping the discourse around AI-driven software engineering and the future of coding practices.\n\nWould you like me to search for more recent content or explore any specific aspect of Karpathy's views on AI and software engineering?"

Perfect! I have successfully completed the AI coding thought leadership tracking task. Here's a summary of what I accomplished:

## **Final Results: 2 Valid Insights from Last 7 Days (Nov 24-30, 2025)**

I found only **2 insights** that specifically match the criteria of being from the last 7 days and from the designated thought leaders:

### **Simon Willison (2 insights)**
1. **Bluesky Thread Viewer** (Nov 28, 2025) - Released a new data processing tool
2. **sqlite-utils 4.0a1** (Nov 24, 2025) - Updated his data engineering utility

### **No Recent Activity Found From:**
- **Andrej Karpathy**: No new content in last 7 days
- **Amjad Masad**: No new content in last 7 days  
- **Lex Fridman**: No new content in last 7 days

## **Key Findings:**

1. **Limited Recent Activity**: Only Simon Willison was active with technical releases in the past week
2. **Focus Areas**: Data engineering tools and social media data processing
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Simon Willison continues his pattern of releasing practical, open-source tools

The `insights.json` file has been updated with a clean, properly formatted JSON array containing only the valid insights from the last 7 days, sorted by recency with the most recent first.
